            Why are some contributions attributed only to “Individual”?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Although the FEC publishes detailed information about anyone who
            contributes to political candidates or campaigns, the goal of this
            project is not to draw attention to the many everyday people who
            choose to make small contributions to support their favored causes
            or candidates. For those who don’t appear to be executives or
            senior-level employees at these companies, I have redacted
            identifying information.

            Why are some political advertisements missing?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Although the FEC tracks ad spending, they do not maintain a database
            of the advertisements themselves. I am doing my best to gather this
            information as I am able, but databases with this information are
            either limited or prohibitively expensive. If you’re aware of an
            advertisement that’s missing, please<!-- -->

            What’s going on with the list of PACs? Why aren’t the amounts
            belonging to each PAC displayed?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are some errors in FEC data, generally where in-kind
            cryptocurrency contributions have been double-reported or even
            triple-reported. While the FEC accounts for this by recording a
            disbursement for each duplicate contribution, it causes the receipts
            data to appear artificially high. Because I am only calculating
            committee receipts (accounting for duplicates) for the
            cryptocurrency-related PACs, and it is not feasible for me to do
            this type of labor-intensive data correction across all political
            committees, I am showing the order of PACs as reflected by the FEC,
            while acknowledging that PACs with cryptocurrency-denominated
            contributions may appear slightly too highly. To avoid propogating
            numbers that I know are inaccurate, I no longer show the
            FEC-reported PAC receipts in the lists of PACs.
          </p>
          <h3 id="discrepancies">Why do some numbers not seem to add up?</h3>
          <p>
            You might notice that there are some discrepancies between numbers —
            for example, committees that appear to have spent more than they’ve
            raised, or cash on hand that doesn’t equal receipts - disbursements.
            This is largely due to the fact that different data is subject to
            different reporting requirements and timeframes. For example, the
            FEC requires that committees report independent expenditures within
            24 or 48 hours of the expenditure, but receipts are reported monthly
            or quarterly. This site aims to show the most up-to-date data as
            possible, at the expense of occasionally unusual numbers.
          </p>
          <h3 id="recent">
            Why does it look like there hasn’t been much recent spending
            activity?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are delays between when expenditures are made and when they
            are filed with the FEC. This project attempts to pull as much as
            possible from<!-- -->

          <h3 id="crypto-or-dollars">
            Are these people and companies donating cryptocurrency or regular
            dollars?
          </h3>
          <p>It’s a mix, but anecdotally it appears to be mostly dollars.</p>
          <h3 id="blockchain">Does this project use blockchain data?</h3>
          <p>
            No, the monetary data for this project comes from reports to the FEC
            (which includes donations made both in dollars and in
            cryptocurrency). This project does not aim to track dark money
            political spending that is not reported to the FEC.

          <h3 id="what-about">
            Who cares what the cryptocurrency industry is doing when
            [oil|pharma|banking|some other industry] also spends millions on
            lobbying and politics?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I do! As a crypto industry researcher, this is something I pay a lot
            of attention to. However, I also think the magnitude of spending
            warrants scrutiny from a much broader audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I <i>firmly</i> agree that corporate influence on politics is a much
            broader issue than just in the cryptocurrency industry. The broader
            problem is<a
